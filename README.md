# Kako Botnet
This is a Python DDoS botnet.<br>
This botnet may have a few bugs, but, for what I have seen it works so far<br>
If I have made fixes I will post them here and state what was fixed<br>
# Compiling
Ok so if you are trying to use this botnet for mass infecting busy boxes or something like that. I recommend Nuitka it allows you to compile python2 or 3 into a linux binary file<br>
